# Serilog.Sinks.Discord

A Serilog sink that writes log events to a Discord channel via Discord Webhooks. The log events will be shown as an
embed in the Discord channel.

### Getting started

To use the Discord sink, first install
the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Stein121.Serilog.Sinks.Discord)

```shell
dotnet add package Stein121.Serilog.Sinks.Discord
```

Then enable the sink using `WriteTo.Discord()`:

```csharp
Log.Logger = new Logger Configuration()
    .WriteTo.Discord(<WEBHOOK_ID>, <WEBHOOK_TOKEN>)
    .CreateLogger();

Log.Information("Hello, world!");
```

Log events will be shown in the Discord channel:

### Log Levels

```csharp
Log.Logger = new Logger Configuration()
    .WriteTo.Discord(<WEBHOOK_ID>, <WEBHOOK_TOKEN>)
    .CreateLogger();

Log.Verbose("This is a Verbose message");
Log.Debug("This is a Debug message");
Log.Information("This is an Information message");
Log.Warning("This is a Warning message");
Log.Error("This is an Error message");
Log.Fatal("This is a Fatal message");
```

### Exception

```csharp
Log.Logger = new Logger Configuration()
    .WriteTo.Discord(<WEBHOOK_ID>, <WEBHOOK_TOKEN>)
    .CreateLogger();

try
{
    throw new Exception("Example exception thrown");
}
catch (Exception e)
{
    Log.Error(e, "This is an Error message with an Exception passed in");
}
```

### Batch logging

The Discord sink by default sends 1 message with as many embeds as possible (max 10) every 2 seconds. The `batchTimeMs`
can be configured to be 0 to send immediately. Do note that spamming the Discord webhook too fast will cause the overall
logging to slow down, it is better to send in batches to stay below the Discord rate limits.

```csharp
Log.Logger = new Logger Configuration()
    .WriteTo.Discord(<WEBHOOK_ID>, <WEBHOOK_TOKEN>, batchTimeMs: 2000) // default is 2000ms, set 0 for no batching
    .CreateLogger();
```

### Usage with Async Wrapper

It takes awhile for the Discord sink to send the log to Discord channel. In some cases it might be better to wrap it
with `Serilog.Sinks.Async` so that your program does not wait for the log message to reach discord (kind of 'log and
forget').

```shell
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Console
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Async
```

```csharp
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .WriteTo.Console()
    // wrap discord with async wrapper
    .WriteTo.Async(a => a.Discord(<WEBHOOK_ID>, <WEBHOOK_TOKEN>))
    .CreateLogger();

for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i)
{
    Log.Information($"{i}");
}

// The console should show 0-4 first
// Discord channel should take awhile before showing 0-4

// Wait for all logs to finish before exiting
Log.CloseAndFlush();
```

### Long log messages

The sink is designed to send the log messages as embeds in Discord channels. As of this writing, the limit for the
embed's description is `4096`.
See [https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/channel#embed-limits)
for more limits.

The sink will split a long message (>`4096` characters) into multiple embed messages. It will try to first split at a
newline `'\n'`, then try to split at a space `' '`, then finally it resorts to breaking the word to fit the embed
limits.
